- **Kaggle Account** (optional, to visualize the daatsets used): To download the datasets.

### Configuration and Running
1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dayehhadi/AI-Home-Doctor-Chatbot
   cd AI-Home-Doctor-Chatbot
   ```
2. **Setup a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate # For windows
   ```

3. **Add Environment Variables**

In Your DockerFile fill the folllowing:

   ```
   ENV SECRET_TOKEN = '' # Your OpenAI API Key 
   ENV GMAIL_PASS = '' # Password of the account used to send reminders
   ENV GMAIL_USER = '' # email of the account used to send reminders
   ```

4. **Run a Docker Image**

In the directory that has the Dockerfile, run the following:
   ```
   docker build -t chatbot-home-doctor .

   docker run -p 5000:5000 --name chatbot-container chatbot-home-doctor

   #or run from docker and use port 5000 
   ```
5. **Starting the Flask server**

THe Dockerfile opens a terminal in the root repository and run the following:
